# Factors-affecting-house-prices-in-the-last-20-years
An exploratory data analysis was conducted to see what factors have affected the housing market in the last twenty years.

So basically summing up my observations:

The median price of the houses steadily increase from 1999 till the end of 2006. There is a decrease in the prices till the end of 2008. It has been increasing since then.

The ratio of the houses for sales to houses sold is the highest in December 2008, the ratio gradually increased from 2004 till end of 2008, which means less houses were sold compared to the houses there were for sale. The ratio gradually decreases from 2008 and there are spikes in the graph but the lowest ratio is during the 2nd quarter of the year 2020.

There is an increasing slope from 2002 till the first month of 2006, then there is a huge decrease in newly built homes till may of 2009 which stays consistent till 2012 and then the construction spending increased from 2012 and has been increasing since then.

There is a noticeable upward trend where the mortgage increased from 1999-2000,then a decreasing slope from 2000-2003. The mortagage almost stay consistent from 2003-2008 and there is downward slope from 2008 where there is a decrease till 2013. The rates stay consistent throughout from 2013 till 2018, after that there is a significant decrease in the rates.

The lowest units of permits granted was in 2009, then the permit units had an increase till 2014 and has been gradually increasing from then.

There is a negative slope from 2004 till 2016. The home ownership rates go really down during this time period and then increases again from 2016 till 2020 and then it decreases again from then.

On plotting the unemployement rate according to the dates, I see a increasing slope from January of 2007 till end of 2009 which indicates an increase in employement rate. Also the employement rate decreases from end of 2009 till January of 2020 and then has a sharp increase in the first 6 months of 2020 and then decreases again.

I see an increasing slope from the year 1986 - 2006 which means the price indices did increase till 2006 and remained the same in 2007 but there is a decreasing slope from 2007 till 2011 which indicates that the indices decreased in that time period but continued to increase from 2011 till now.

So to sum it up there are the main time periods that have noticeable changes are usually from 2006-2009 and then after 2018. Housing prices peaked in early 2006, started to decline in 2006 and 2007, and reached new lows in 2012. On December 30, 2008, the Caseâ€“Shiller home price index reported its largest price drop in its history. Similarly the unemployement rate hits a low during this period of time. The lowest units of permits granted was in 2009. Mortgages also decrease in the same time period. The construction spending also decreased in the same time period. The ratio of the houses for sales to houses sold is the highest in December 2008, the ratio gradually increased from 2004 till end of 2008, which means less houses were sold compared to the houses there were for sale.

After 2018, the home prices indices has increased till 2021, reaching its highest. The unemployement rate also reaches its lowest in 2020. The home ownership rates also decreases from 2020. The average mortgage rate has also decreased in this time period reaching its lowest in 2021. the construction spending increased from 2012 and has been the highest in 2021. The ratio of the houses for sales to houses sold is the lowest in 2020, which means there were less houses for sale. The median price of hosuings also increased reaching its maximum in 2021.
